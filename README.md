# Knapsack
[Knapsack problem Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The code is my own work, test instances not.

Part of my project in Algorithm Design during College, don't copy and paste my work pretending to be yours.
